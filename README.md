# Fluid Simulation with Zig and Raylib

Welcome to this project, the aim for this is to learn Zig and raylib along the way.
And also have fun as I really like the idea of making a fluid simulation.

## Features

- Real-time 2D fluid simulation.
- Rendering with Raylib to actually see something.
- Probably not the best code you will ever see.

### Stack Used

1. **Zig**: The latest version of the Zig programming language.  
   [Ziglang Org](https://ziglang.org/)
    #### NOTE : keep in mind zig is as of writing this in 0.14.0, so this is subject to major change in the future.

2. **Raylib**: A C library for graphics.  
   [Download Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

3. **Raylib-Zig**: Zig bindings for Raylib.
    [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig)
